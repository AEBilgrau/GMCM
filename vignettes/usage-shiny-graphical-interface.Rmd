A graphical user interface to the **GMCM** package is available both on- and
offline through the [**shiny**](https://shiny.rstudio.com) package.
The application supports both general GMCMs for unsupervised clustering as
well as the special GMCMs for reproduciblity analysis.
The online
**shiny** application is available at
[gmcm.shinyapps.io/GMCM/](https://gmcm.shinyapps.io/GMCM/). 
Alternatively, if you do an local offline instance of the
application, make sure **GMCM** is installed and run

```{r, eval=FALSE}
GMCM::runGMCM()
```

The local version is handy if data cannot be submitted to the online website.
