\usage{
rtheta(m = 3, d = 2, method = c("old", "EqualSpherical",
  "UnequalSpherical", "EqualEllipsoidal", "UnequalEllipsoidal"))
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{The number of components in the mixture.}

\item{d}{The dimension of the mixture distribution.}

\item{method}{The method by which the theta should be generated.
See details. Defaults to \code{"old"} which is the regular "old" behavior.}
}
\value{
A named list of parameters with the 4 elements:
  \item{\code{m}}{An integer giving the number of components in the mixture.
                  Default is 3.}
  \item{\code{d}}{An integer giving the dimension of the mixture
                  distribution. Default is 2.}
  \item{\code{pie}}{A numeric vector of length \code{m} of mixture
                   proportions between 0 and 1 which sums to one.}
  \item{\code{mu}}{A \code{list} of length \code{m} of numeric vectors of
                   length \code{d} for each component.}
  \item{\code{sigma}}{A \code{list} of length \code{m} of variance-covariance
                      matrices (of size \code{d} times \code{d}) for each
                      component.}
}
\description{
Generate a random set parameters for the Gaussian mixture
model (GMM) and Gaussian mixture copula model (GMCM). Primarily, it provides
an easy prototype of the \code{theta}-format used in \pkg{GMCM}.
}
\details{
Depending on the \code{method} argument the parameters are generated as
  follows. The new behavior is inspired by the simulation scenarios in
  Friedman (1989) but not exactly the same.
\itemize{
  \item{\code{pie}
        is generated by \eqn{m} draws of a chi-squared distribution with
        \eqn{3m} degrees of freedom divided by their sum. If
        \code{method = "old"} the uniform distribution is used instead.}
  \item{\code{mu}
        is generated by \eqn{m} i.i.d. \eqn{d}-dimensional zero-mean
        normal vectors with covariance matrix \code{100I}.
        (unchanged from the old behavior)}
  \item{\code{sigma}}{
    is dependent on \code{method}. The covariance matrices for each
    component are generated as follows. If the \code{method} is
    \itemize{
      \item{\code{"EqualSpherical"}, then the covariance matrices are the
            identity matrix and thus are all equal and spherical.}
      \item{\code{"UnequalSpherical"}, then the covariance matrices are
            scaled identity matrices. In component \eqn{h}, the covariance
            matrix is \eqn{hI}}
      \item{\code{"EqualEllipsoidal"}, then highly elliptical covariance
            matrices which equal for all components are used.
            The square root of the \eqn{d} eigenvalues are chosen
            equidistantly on
            the interval \eqn{10} to \eqn{1} and a randomly (uniformly)
            oriented orthonormal basis is chosen and used for all
            components.}
      \item{\code{"UnqualEllipsoidal"}, then highly elliptical covariance
            matrices different for all components are used.
            The eigenvalues of the covariance matrices equal as in all
            components as in \code{"EqualEllipsoidal"}. However, they are all
            randomly (uniformly) oriented (unlike as described in
            Friedman (1989)).}
      \item{\code{"old"}, then the old behavior is used.
            The old behavior differs from \code{"EqualEllipsoidal"} by using
            the absolute value of \eqn{d} zero-mean i.i.d. normal
            eigenvalues with a standard deviation of 8.}
    }}
  In all cases, the orientation is selected uniformly.

The function \code{\link{is.theta}} checks whether or not \code{theta}
  is in the correct format.
